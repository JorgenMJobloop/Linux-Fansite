      <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
      <p>
        Linux is built by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a
        >. The "Linux-kernel" is a alternative
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">kernel</a>
        built on UNIX. And is nowadays a valid competitor to Apple's UNIX-based
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU-Kernel</a>. And
        Microsoft's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT"
          >NT-Kernel</a
        >. One of the Linux-kernel's greatest strenghts, is the freedom each
        developer have, to implement it and built full systems and operating
        systems, upon it's technology, and thereby creating a more diverse
        technology marked, where each user has a right to choose.

      <p>
        What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">GNU?</a><br /><br />
        From wikipedia:
        <em
          >GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!",[6][12] chosen
          because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free
          software and containing no Unix code.[6][13][14] Stallman chose the
          name by using various plays on words, including the song The
          Gnu.[4]: 45:30

          The Linux Foundation<br />
          From wikipedia:<em
            >The Linux Foundation (LF) is a non-profit technology consortium
            founded in 2000 as a merger between Open Source Development Labs and
            the Free Standards Group to standardize Linux, support its growth,
            and promote its commercial adoption. Additionally, it hosts and
            promotes the collaborative development of open source software
            projects.[2][3][4] The foundation was launched in 2000, under the
            Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) and became the organization it
            is today when OSDL merged with the Free Standards Group (FSG). The
            Linux Foundation sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds
            and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman. Furthermore, it is supported
            by members, such as AT&T, Cisco, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, Huawei,
            IBM, Intel, Meta,[5] Microsoft,[6] NEC, Oracle, Orange S.A.,
            Qualcomm, Samsung,[7] Tencent, and VMware, as well as developers
            from around the world.</em
